# Intelligent-identification-platform

The project is to providing a framework which allow user to interact with the vision solution. The outline is shown below:

![Project framework](https://github.com/31-bit/Intelligent-identification-platform/blob/master/Project_structure.png)

### collector:
provide fetch image function, to get the camera image and store it the device temporally **(you may change the temp path here)**  
### Sheduler: 
The main function of whole project. Taking action by using cronjob in system level. To start up, user have to configure in system terminal, please follow the insturction below.  
### CNN:
function module. A well trained model is expected to recogonize whether a image is a car or not, and write it into two dictionary car or non-car. Currently providing two user API for training and predicting.  
### S3: 
(not contained in this respository) Store image in Web, saving local memory and computing resources. Write in a image, return a URL of the image. And also provide api for frontend to look the Pic by URL.  
### database: 
store the image information except the image itself, and also model detials.  


Scheduler module is the main file
setting cronjob in command line by following procedure.

```
*/1 * * * * /bin/date >> /User/time.txt
*/1 * * * * /opt/homebrew/anaconda3/envs/opencv/bin/python3.10 /Users/leonard/PycharmProjects/opencv/Scheduler.py
```
## what the project do
The project is to build a platform for a vision solution in industry. Built for several situation:
1. In a car manifacturing line, it may capture the image with presetting time period. It may recogoize is it a car image or not. It may detact is there flaw on car.
2. In a express transportationï¼Œit may help the deliveryman to automaticlly record the delievery data and update to backend.

During above situation, this project provide the collector to interface with the camera device, CNN module to detact is it a car image or not.


backend, frontend, database and S3 source code are not contained in this respository. Further image detaction function may added.

## Environment build up

## CNN module - car detection-result
